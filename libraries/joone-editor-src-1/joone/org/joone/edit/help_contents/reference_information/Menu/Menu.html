<h1>Menu Usage</h1>
<br>
Menu Items are displayed along the top of the Joone Editor. <br>
Clicking on an item will reveal a list of menu options which can be
clicked to active the item. <br>
Items followed by three dots will lead to a new window for further
input. Other items will directly perform the operation.
