<h2>The Synapses</h2>
The Synapse represents the connection between two layers, permitting a
pattern to be passed from one layer to another. <br>
The Synapse is also the ‘memory’ of a neural network. During the
training process the weigh of each connection is modified according the
implemented learning algorithm. <br>
Remember that, as described above, a synapse is both the output synapse
of a layer and the input synapse of the next connected layer in the NN,
hence it represents a shared resource between two Layers (no more than
two, because a Synapse can be attached only once as the input or the
output of a Layer).<br>
<br>
To avoid a layer trying to read the pattern from its input synapse
before the other layer has written it, the shared synapse in
synchronized; in other terms, a semaphore based mechanism prevents two
Layers from accessing simultaneously to a shared Synapse.
<h3>The Direct Synapse</h3>
The DirectSynapse represents a direct connection 1-to-1 between the
nodes of the two connected layers, as depicted in the following figure:
<p lang="en-GB" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><img
 src="Synapses_html_46872152.gif" name="Object38" align="left"
 width="250" height="184"><br clear="left">
<br>
</p>
Each connection has a weight equal to 1, and it doesn't change during
the learning phase. <br>
Of course, a DirectSynapse can connect only layers having the same
numbers of neurons, or nodes.
<h3>The Full Synapse<br>
</h3>
The FullSynapse connects all the nodes of a layer with all the nodes of
the other layer, as depicted in the following figure:
<p lang="en-GB" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br>
</p>
<p lang="en-GB" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><img
 src="Synapses_html_5c0dd819.gif" align="left"><br clear="left">
<br>
</p>
This is the most common type of synapse used in a neural network, and
its weights change during the learning phase according to the
implemented learning algorithm. <br>
It can connect layers having a whatever number of neurons, and the
number of the weights contained is equal to N<sub>1</sub> x N<sub>2</sub>,
where N<sub>x</sub> is the number of nodes of the Layer<sub>x</sub>
<h3>The Delayed Synapse</h3>
This Synapse has an architecture similar to which of the FullSynapse,
but each connection is implemented using a matrix of FIR Filter
elements of size NxM.<br>
<br>
The following figure illustrates how a DelaySynapses can be represented:
<p lang="en-GB" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"> </p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><img
 src="Synapses_html_m72b5ec27.gif" align="left"><br clear="left">
</p>
As you can see in the first figure, each connection – represented with
a greyed rectangle - is implemented as a FIR (Finite Impulse Response)
filter and in the second figure the internal detail of a FIR filter is
shown. <br>
A FIRFilter connection is a delayed connection that permits to
implement a temporal backprop algorithm functionally equivalent to the
TDNN (Time Delay Neural Network), but in a more efficient and elegant
manner. <br>

Tapped Delay-Lines</i>, Eric Wan, in <u>Time Series Prediction:

 lang="en-US"> you can find some good examples using FIR filters.</span>
<h3>The Kohonen Synapse</h3>
The KohonenSynapse belongs to a special kind of components that permit
to build  unsupervised neural networks. <br>
This components, in particular, is the central element of the SOM (Self
Organizing Maps) networks. A KohonenSynapse must be followed necessarily
by a WTALayer or a GaussianLayer component, forming so a complete SOM,
like depicted in this figure:
<p lang="en-GB" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br>
</p>
<p lang="en-GB" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><img
 src="Synapses_html_585f9076.gif" align="left"><br clear="left">
<br>
</p>
As you can see, a SOM is composed normally by three elements:
<ol>
	<li>A LinearLayer that is 	used as input layer 	</li>
  <li>A WTALayer (or 	GaussianLayer) that's used as output layer 	 	</li>
  <li>A KohonenSynapse that 	connects the two above layers </li>
</ol>
<p lang="en-GB" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br>
</p>
During the training phase, the KohonenSynapse's weights are adjusted to
map the N-dimensional input patterns to the 2D map represented by the
output synapse.<br>
<br>
What is the difference between the WTA and the Gaussian layers? The
answer is very simple, and depends on the precision of the response we
want from the network. <br>
If we're, for instance, using a SOM to make predictions (for instance
to forecast the next day's weather), probably we need to use a
GaussianLayer as output, because we want a response in terms of
percentage around a given value (it will be cloudy and maybe it will
rain), whereas if we'are using a SOM to recognize handwritten
characters, we need a precise response, (like '<i>the character is A</i>',
but not '<i>the character could be A or B</i>') hence in this case we
need to use a WTALayer, that activates one (and only one) neuron for
each input pattern.
<h3>The Sanger Synapse<br>
</h3>
The SangerSynapse serves to build unsupervisioned neural networks that
apply the PCA (Principal Component Analysis) algorithm. <br>
The PCA is a well known and widely used technique that permits to
extract the most important components from a signal. The Sanger
algorithm, in particular, extracts the components in ordered mode –
from the most meaningful to the less one – so permitting to separate
the noise from the true signal. <br>
This components, by reducing the number of input values without
diminishing the useful signal, permits to train the network on a given
problem reducing considerably the training time. <br>
The SangerSynapse normally is posed between two LinearLayers, and the
output layer has less neurons than the input layer, as depicted in the
following figure:
<p lang="en-GB" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><img
 src="Synapses_html_59311d4d.gif" align="left"><br clear="left">
<br>
</p>
By using this synapse along with the Nested Neural Network component
it's very easy to build modular neural networks where the first NN acts
as a pre-processing element that reduces the number of the input
columns and consequently its noise.
